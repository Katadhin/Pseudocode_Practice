# Define a function to find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm

    # Initialize the distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity

    # Set the distance for the starting node to 0

    # Create a set to keep track of visited nodes

    # Loop to find the shortest path for all nodes

        # Find the node with the minimum distance that has not been visited

        # Mark the current node as visited

        # Update the distance to neighboring nodes through the current node

# Define a sample weighted graph as a dictionary of dictionaries

# Define the starting node

# Call the function to find the shortest distances from the start node

# Print the result
